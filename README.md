SplitSol: Decentralized Expense Splitting
SplitSol is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain that allows groups of friends or coworkers to track and settle expenses transparently. No more "who owes who"—every transaction is verified and recorded on-chain.

Expense Tracking: Log expenses with descriptions and automatic split calculations.

On-Chain Settlements: Pay your share directly using SOL.

Real-time History: View a transparent ledger of all group activities.

Non-Custodial: Your funds stay in your wallet until you decide to pay.
